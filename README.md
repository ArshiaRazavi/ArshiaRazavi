Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Arshia!

ðŸ‘€ Interests:
Iâ€™m passionate about exploring the intersection of physics, neuroscience and AI. 
My current research focuses on biological neural network simulations, specifically Izhikevich networks with plasticity for learning and memory storage. Iâ€™m also interested in broader applications of computational models, AI in neuroscience, and data-driven research that pushes boundaries in understanding the brain.
